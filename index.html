							In the following analysis, I dive deep into at the UVM men's basketball team's offense. Using every possessions from 5 games -- Dartmouth (H), Albany (A), Stony Brook (A), Hartford (A), and UMBC (H) -- I conduct a data analysis breaking down the points per possession for situational offense (halfcourt vs. transition vs. putbacks), kinds of halfcourt possession (set offense vs. base offense), and shot type (Contested 3, Semi contested layups, open 2, etc.). In a video analysis, I pinpoint key areas of offense and ways to boost efficiency in these areas. They are the impact of Anthony Lamb's Gravity on the court, situational basket cuts, bigs as offensive catalysts, optimizing pick and roll, post seals to create penetration lanes, and reads regarding screens. Finally, I discuss more abstract concepts of offense and a global philosophy.

						<div class = "section-text">
								The following graph shows the points per possession for different types of possessions. The most efficient possessions were transition, followed by putbacks and then halfcourt. This is close to what we would expect - putbacks and transition should be more efficient than halfcourt offense. The question is, should we expect a gap in efficiency this large?

							    <div class = "section-text">
							    	Let's take a look at  shot selection. We can see that open layups are the most efficient shot by far followed by open 3's and semi consted 3's. I expect that over a larger sample size open 3's would rise in points per possession. Floater's and contested shots are the least efficient.

							    	 Now lets look at the breakdown in the shots UVM got in the halfcourt vs. transition. We can see the kinds of shots that the offense gets in transition are in general better than the shots the offense gets in the halfcourt. Transition results in a higher percentage of open 3's and open layups, but has a higher rate in contested and semi-contested layups. Transition also has a much lower percentage of contested 3's, and I counted zero contested and semi contested 2's as well as floaters. All in all, it makes a lot sense that transition would result in a higher expected point total. There is more space, the defense is less set, and there is the potential for man advantages. But the question remains, how can we create more transition like opportunities in the halfcourt? Specifically, how can we create more open 3's and open layups?

							    	The best way to create these kinds of opportunity is with smart offense. Good set plays combined with a knowledge of opposing defenses should create good scoring opportunities in the half court. Let's take a look at the points per possession of set plays, base offense, and zone offense. From the film I watched, I am not suprised to see zone offense as the most efficient. The soft 3-2 zones a number of the teams run have gaps all over the floor and don't make it particularly difficult on opposing offenses. The number of zone possessions (19) was far lower than set (160) and base (93), probably in part because UVM was very efficient against zone. Set plays came with a higher points per possession than base offense, and this is also to be expected. The question is, can both set and base offense be made more efficient? Can the offense get the same kinds of shots in the halfcourt as it does against zone and in transition?

								This is a difficult question to answer without in depth data on college offenses throughout the country, but one mode of comparison is the NBA. The NBA isn't a perfect comparison, so I will first discuss some of the problems between comparing the NBA and college. The first is the rules. Due to the franchise setup of the NBA, the discrepency in teams is not as high from top to bottom than in college. The better college programs can attract better talent, the better NBA teams get worse draft picks. The defensive three second rule in the NBA makes it much more difficult for NBA teams to contain opposing offenses. Another are of difference is the skill level of the players. There is an argument to be made that the gap in offensive skill and defensive skill in the NBA is larger than college. The consistency of defensive effort is certainly lower in the NBA. The sum of these differences would suggest that NBA teams woud be more efficient in the halfcourt than college teams. As it turns out, that is the case. <a href = 'https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/league/context#tab-offense_halfcourt_putbacks'>The median points per possession in the halfcourt in the NBA is .95</a> - a signifcantly higher number.

								There is one difference between the NBA and college that I deliberately haven't mentioned, and it is the most crucial in the context of this analysis. NBA players make better offensive decisions. They are more experienced, and better trained. They recognize patterns in defenses better. They can make more precise reads. These are all things that come with time, but decision making ability can be accelerated by good coaching. I propose that the greatest room for improvement in the UVM offense is decision making. With that being said let's take a look at some film.

							For the following film analysis, I looked at every possession from 5 games: Dartmouth (H), Albany (A), Stony Brook (A), Hartford (A), and UMBC (H). My goal was to find ways for the offense to be more efficient, particularly in high usage areas of the offense. I came to the conclusion that the six most important areas for increased efficiency were taking advantage of Anthony Lamb's court gravity, increasing situational basket cuts, using bigs along the perimeter, decision making in the pick and roll, using penetration lanes created by post seals, and improving reads regarding screens.

									<p>In football there is a concept that some players tilt the defense in their direction. If a defense believes that a single player is dangerous enough, they may commit extra defenders to his side of the field in order to contain him. Tyreek Hill of the Chiefs comes to mind. His speed is so lethal that defenses often trade a balanced defensive structure in order to mitigate the threat of a long touchdown. This defensive strategy can work, but an offense can exploit this defensive strategy if it is able to take advantage of the extra space provided for the other players.</p> 

									<p>Anthony Lamb is a defensive tilting player. When he catches the ball in a dangerous position, or there is a threat of him catching the ball in a dangerous position, the help defense gravitates towards him. Below are a number of examples where the defense tries to nullify the threat of Lamb. In some cases, the offense executes on the advantage of an over helping defense, other times not. I focus on ways to use the gravity Lamb has on a defense to maximum effect. </p>

										</div>

										<p class = "film-analysis-text">There are a number of positive outcomes that can come from this action. If Davis catches the ball in this space and his defender steps with him, Lamb has already sealed his defender for a layup. It is also likely that Shungu's defender will become distracted by this action, priming for a backdoor cut. </p>

										<p>This highlights a greater point of Lamb as a screen setter. From the film I have analyzed, Lamb is a great, but inconsistent screen setter. Sometimes he doesn't fully commit, or put in full effort to a screen, but when he does he almost always creates space for the player he is screening. It is extemely valuable when Lamb sets a good screen because defense must decide between helping off of Lamb, or allowing an open cut to happen. If Lamb commits to becoming a more consistent screener, the effects can be devastating.</p>

You could have Robin stay in the corner but, even though his defender isn't guarding him, he is still in the passing lane and could get a deflection. The best option for me is Robin making a backdoor cut to create a new passing lane, and though help will probably come from the other side of the floor, a kick out three to Patella is likely. </p>

								<div class = "section-description film-analysis-description">
									<p>There are few actions that can create easy layup opportunities like a timely basket cut. However, there are some considerations for a player to make before making a basket cut like whether cutting will clog the space in the middle for another player, or whether staying in their current position gives them a better opportunity to get the ball in space than cutting would. Making a cut is inherently a risk. It won't always pay off, but when it does not only does it create easy scoring opportunities, but it also forces the defense to respect the cut. Lanes for basket cuts arise when a defense is anticipating helping off another action. If the defense knows players will make basket cuts when they over-anticipate, the help will not be as strong on penetration. In the following section, I outline numerous situations primed for basket cuts. </p> 

									<p>As a general rule, a basket cut is an effective option when a ball handler is driving towards an offensive player in the post or in the corner.  </p>

									<div class = "header4">Example 1</div>

										<p class = "film-analysis-text">   If Lamb makes a basket cut to the opposite post, it achieves a couple of things. It means that his defender must either follow him and open up a finish at the rim for Everett, or stay and leave Lamb open at the opposite post (often times Lamb's defender won't even see the cut because he is focused on the help). Lamb cutting to the opposite post also opens up the space for Robin in the corner. </p>

A drive to the middle like this is best thought of as spinning a gear. Everyone along the perimeter rotates starting with Smith in the corner. </p>

This is the pass the defense wants you to make. If Patella shoots immediately, it will likely be contested because the defender's momentum is moving in that direction. A fake shot into drive is an ok option, but by that time help will have arrived on the weak side. An immediate drive allows the corner defender to recover to the baseline and cut off any advantage in the middle.</p>

In situations like this where Shungu has even a slight advantage, he should err on the side of being aggressive. The best way to create an advantage is to attack an advantage that already exists. </p>

										<p class = "film-analysis-text">
											To build on a previous point, it also makes sense for Deloney to clear to the other side, both for the opportunity of a backdoor cut and to clear space for Shungu on the drive. The ideal timing would be right before Davis hands off to Shungu, so Deloney doesnt clog space for Davis on the roll. Everett would push up the wing.

									<p>The pick and roll and its many variations are a staple of any modern offense. Maximizing the efficiency of pick and rolls has a large impact on the efficiency of the offense at large due to the sheer quantity of pick and roll actions. After analyzing the pick and rolls in UVM's offense, I found many examples where small tweaks to the execution of the pick and roll could result in a boost in efficiency. </p>

									<div class = "header4">Example 1</div>

										<p class = "film-analysis-text">The first concept that is important when thinking about the pick and roll is attacking the initial advantage that comes from a high ball screen. If the ball handler's man goes over the screen, it is likely that he will have a step on his defender and/or the big steps up to stop penetration. </p>

										<p class = "film-analysis-text">Against Hartford, Smith is coming off a Davis high screen and indeed has a step on his defender. Smith delays his attack which allows his defender to recover and get back square. Smith settles for a difficult midrange shot. </p>

										<p class = "film-analysis-text"> Consider also the application of the basket cut principle here. If Shungu makes an early basket cut (right after Smith receives the ball), he will likely be open backdoor. If he is not, he can clear to the other side before impacting Davis's space on the roll.

He starts with a screen angle which would have Robin go to his left, but then pulls out of his screen appearing to reset for a screen to the right. The obvious thing to notice here is a screen to Robin's left means one fewer defender to help off of penetration. Robin sees the advantage to his left and attacks despite not really using the screen. If Davis had committed to the screen Robin's advantage would have been even greater.   </p>

When an advantage is there, take it. (must be said that in order for this progression to work Davis, must be anticipate the help coming)  </p>

										<p class = "film-analysis-text">On this pick and roll, Davis sets the screen to the stronger side of the floor. Even though this play ended in a basket for Davis, I believe the better option was to for Davis to pop after the screen. Firstly, Stony Brook's pick and roll defense was poor in this instance. When Smith gets deep, it is clear that Davis's defender has him contained. The only play for Smith is to pass to Davis and Smith's defender should have recognized this and switched on to Davis. Better execution by the defense and a pass to Davis would have resulted in a turnover. </p>

									</div>
									<div class = "film-analysis-text-block">
										<p class = "film-analysis-text"> There are also many positives to a Davis pop. The first is it opens up the space for Lamb to execute the basket cut principle. You can see that even though they have two defenders committed to Smith, Lamb's defender is still partially focused on Smith (also notice his momentum instinctively goes to the corner). If Lamb makes a basket cut, it opens up the corner for Shungu which would make his defender stunting towards Smith more consequential. A Davis pop also opens up a the possibility of a kick to Davis and a handoff with Everett. With Davis's defender occupied with Smith, he would have big trouble helping off a handoff -> screen with Everett. As discussed before this action is a good opportunity for an easy 3 or easy penetration.  </p>

										<div class = "film-analysis-image">
											<img class = "image" src = "images/pick_roll/pick-roll-6.jpg">
										</div>

										<p class = "film-analysis-text"> This isn't to say that this play should be a pick and pop every time. Mixing between pops and rolls forces the defense to respect both options. When a defense isn't sure what the offense is going to do, more gaps occur and executing both versions is easier. </p>

They are an easy way to create space for a player and a system which can maximize the effectiveness of screens will likely be an efficient one.  One of the easiest ways to increase the dynamism of an offense is to implement a read system based on how defenses guard screens. The effectiveness of a screen hinges on the angle it is set and the body positioning of a player. For a screen to be most effective, the screener should set the angle of his body square with the defender to achieve maximum contact. The player running off the screen should set the angle of his run in line with the angle of the screen so that defenses can't go under a screen without consequence. In the following examples, I demonstrate situations where the screener and the person coming off the screen should be making adjustments to maximize the effectiveness of the screen. </p>

Everett correctly expects Patella to come over the top of the screen because his defender is fully anticipating Patella to go under it. Notice how Patella's step to the right creates a great opportunity for Everett to set a perfectly square screen. If Patella were to go over the top of the screen, he could flare for a likely open 3, or curl it and attack Everett's defender.

Smith looks at Davis and sees he is not open, but doesn't recognize that the help is coming from Everett's defender and Everett is wide open. If Everett can get the ball early here, he has a clear lane to attack the basket and commit defenders or score.

This eventually happens, but notice Giddens defender when Smith is about to catch the ball: he is guarding against the curl. If Smith and Gidden are on the same page from the start -- Smith catches, Gidden immediately adjusts his screen to the right, Smith rips through and attacks -- Smith is able to attack without Gidden's player in a position to help. This leaves Lamb's defender as the primary help defender. If Smith attacks Lamb's defender, Lamb will have an opportunity to make a basket cut, or flare to the corner for a 3. As it happens, because the action is delayed, Gidden's defender is able to get in better help position and help penetration. </p>

(1) Smith's defender starts off of him in the help and goes under the screen -> flare for a 3 (2) Smith's defender starts close to him, but still goes under screen -> rip through and attack same side with Gidden screen. If Gidden's defender helps Gidden rolls hard (3) Smith defender goes over the initial screen -> Curl, look for Gidden roll, corner players if help.

								<p>Good offense is about attacking advantages. At the core of structuring an offense is the question: is it better to create an advantage by attacking, or is better to create an advantage with misdirection and motion? This is the key distinction between set offense and base offense. Set offense is naturally more scripted, whereas base offense is more improvisational. Set offense moves to attack, base offense attacks to attack. Both kinds of offenses have their tradeoffs, and the best offenses in my opinion are some combination of both.</p>

								<p>The UVM offense, which skews more towards set offense, could incorporate more base principles to make it harder to defend. Reads are one way to raise the ceiling of a set offense. A read is essentially a departure from the script where a player feels there is an advantageous situation. It is not an insignificant decision to make this kind of read, particularly because it prevents the play from progressing forward as planned. However, I argue that the advantages you achieve by making an early action read outweigh the risk of abandoning the play script. </p>

								<p>From the analysis I have done on the UVM offense, most sets look for particular action at the end of the play. For example, a number of sets look to get Anthony Lamb an entry pass into the post. The argument for seeing a play all the way through is that you get what you want: your best player in a good position. However, more times than not, the position at the end of the play isn't as advantageous as it could be. With modern scouting teams can study opposing teams play and anticipate what the other team is looking for with a particular play. Many of the plays that end with a Lamb post up end up about 15 feet away from the basket and fronted with backside help. It is rare that a team just allows Lamb to catch the ball in a good position in the post. When you make an early action read, you take advantage of the fact that opposing teams know what is coming. Instead of playing into the movement they are anticipating you make an adjustment and counter. When a defense is anticipating they are really taking themselves out of honest guarding position. With an early action read you can turn the defense's game plan against itself. </p>

								<p>Early action reads also increase the repeatability of a play. In most plays there are multiple sequences of action, with the last one being what we really want. However, if you can get success off of early action you can save what you really want for a later point. And not only that but the defense must now respect the early action which will force them to play the later action more honestly. With success on early action, you maximize what you really want out of a set. You get the player you want in the position you want, and you give him the best chance to have this opportunity in space.</p>

								<p>Another benefit of early action reads is the ability to stretch the number of possessions in a game. Particularly against weaker teams, the more possessions in the game the more opportunity to separate yourself. This can be a foolhardy pursuit if the team is taking bad shots early, but with early action reads you increase the likelihood of a good shot early.</p>

								<p>The last major advantage to early action reads is the increase in the basketball IQ of the players. Instead of thinking about offense in terms of scripted plays, the players begin to think about offense in terms of defensive positioning, space, and advantage. These are principles that carry through to any offense at any point.</p>


								<p>Another base principle that is well suited to set offense is the idea of attacking the middle. Attacking the middle commits defenders which opens up open opportunities for others. When a defender commits themselves, it creates an advantage but only if the player makes the correct read and passes to an open player. Once the open player receives it (on the perimeter or otherwise) they should be in an advantage. Their job upon receiving the ball is to take the advantage they are given, and create a larger advantage for themselves or another player. This pattern is the core of good offense. A small advantage is turned into a bigger advantage, until a player has a good scoring opportunity. </p>

								<p>It is important to note that committed defenders are not always committed physically. Often times help defenders commit their attention to attacks and this is just as valuable. As discussed in the section on basket cuts, when the attention of a help defender is focused on another player, they leave themselves vulnerable to basket cuts. This is why making basket cuts when a player drives into the center can be so effective. Defenders are trained to focus their attention on what is perceived to be most dangerous. Penetration in the middle are usually in this category. When help has penetration contained, the ball handler is no longer the most dangerous player on the court, rather it is the off ball players. But, off ball defenders still often focus their attention on the ball even when the ball handler is not dangerous. In order to best use an advantage, the person with the ball must be able to recognize committed defenders, and off ball players must recognize the best way they can take advantage of the fact that their defender is committed. Usually, off ball players should move when their defender commits themself to the help because it often makes it more difficult for the defender to recover.</p>

								<p>This brings me back to the notion of attacks initiating a 'spinning of the offensive gear'. When a player drives to the middle, everyone else on the offense rotating is the same direction makes it very difficult on the help. Let's revisit a play from the basket cut section.</p>

								<div class = "film-analysis-image">
									<img class = "image" src = "images/basket_cuts/cut-discussion.jpg">
								</div>

								 <p>We can see that one defender is truly committed to the help, but every single defender is committed with their attention. Everett drives to the middle with his left, everyone on the perimeter should rotate left. Not only does this principle open up gaps and passing lanes that are difficult to defend, but it also achieves synchronized and purposeful movement. It is possible to study and anticipate synchronized and purposeful movement in a set — but much harder to anticipate synchronized and purposeful movement as a principle. This achieves what I believe to be central to good offense and that is forcing the defense to defend. It sounds simplistic but the worst quality of an offense is one that is static. Static offenses are easy to help off of. Great offenses punish help. Great offenses are dynamic. Great offenses force the defense to defend. Achieving synchronized and purposeful movement as an offensive principle is what I believe to be the key to taking a good offense and making it great.</p>
